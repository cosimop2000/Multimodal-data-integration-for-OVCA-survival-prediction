# Multimodal data integration for OVCA survival prediction

## AIM of the project

Predicting Overall Survival (OS, time between the diagnosis and the death) is
crucial for patient treatment as it can be used to increase the number and
types of follow up for the specific patient (personalized treatment). The
prediction of overall survival depends simultaneously on both the structural
characteristics of the tissue and the molecular ones. To date, most models
mainly use molecular data. Still, simultaneously, integrating molecular data
and histological images could be advantageous.

## Data 

Images and molecular data from ovarian cancer patients from https://gdc.cancer.gov/
